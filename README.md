# CreditScore

A simple single screen credit reporting app that animates score from 0 to 514

I added a basic animation to the progress bar using **CABasicAnimation** and the score label using **CADisplayLink**.

I also added a **UITapGestureRecognizer** (Tap) that resets and re-fetches new values from the server/endpoint and animates both the circularShapeLayer and scoreLabel again.
